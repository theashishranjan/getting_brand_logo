getting_brand_logo
==================
This code does two things

1. crawls cnn website to get fortune 500 companies names
2. use the above list to crawl brandsofworld.com to get their respective logos

Python is used. 

```javascript
var test = 'markdown'
```

You can remove the proxy lines of urllib2 is you don't work behind a proxy

Cheers
